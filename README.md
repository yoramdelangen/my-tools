# My tooling projects

I Often like to automate, dumb, or repetative tasks. Mainly the once that requires me to
open other tools, like password managers, websites to look ip IP's or note taking tools.

Therefore I sometimes have ideas to resolve my struggles.

## Dumbstuff

- `java-byte-array`: sometimes I have `byte[]` (in i64[] representation) in Rust but wanted 
to test iteraction with Java. So I wanted to write it as a Java `byte[]` representation.

- `nodejs-container`: I don't like to have `node` installed on my machine, and sometime
alternatives are not an option to use. Work projects for example require me to have `yarn`
where in other people also have to work with.
